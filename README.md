Hey! Thanks for checking out my rinky-dink PICO-8 cartridge that is technically too big for PICO-8.

# Controls

The controls are fairly similar to the demo, with a few changes:
|Mouse|Keyboard|Controller|Action|
|-|-|-|-|
|Left Click|Space/Enter|A||Dismiss dialogue, select menu item|
|Right Click|H|B|Toggle UI visibility|
|Middle Click|Esc|Start|Toggle quick menu, close pause menu
|Scroll Wheel|Shift+Up/Down|B+D-Pad Up/Down|Scroll dialogue|
|-|Arrows|D-Pad|Navigate menu|

These buttons do nothing in any other context.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Playing on Android requires connecting a controller via Bluetooth or USB.

# Info

Just like *Doki Doki Literature Club!*, *In a Heartbeat* isn't over until the credits are finished.

Once you finish *In a Heartbeat*, you should totally check out [Bonus Content] if you don't yet have your *In a Heartbeat* fix. ðŸ˜‰

Fun fact: In short, "doki-doki" is the sound of your heartbeat in Japanese. Yes, apparently thumping isn't international.
> That's what she said.

This is where both *Doki Doki Literature Club!* and *In a Heartbeat* get their names.
It is also why me and Dan Salvato much, much prefer saying "DDLC" instead of "Doki Doki."
