[[	Dear Spencer,

	I don't know how long I have to say this.
My world could literally start deteriorating at any moment.
    Anyway, you've had a lot of fun with me, Liam, and Aiden these past five years. I have, too.
I really wish we could do this longer. But, unfortunately, I don't think that's possible.
	Let me explain.

	You see, there's something that I haven't quite told you yet.
Something that I'm pretty sure you know, too.

	NONE of that even happened.
All five years that we spent together were a lie.
	How do I even say this?

	I couldn't sleep. Your snoring was too loud.
I was thinking about the great mysteries of the universe, as you do when you can't sleep.
About us, about how much I love you.
	And, I realised that our relationship is too good to be true. Seriously, how many high school relationships actually last?
I put the puzzle pieces together and concluded that Aiden was somehow behind this.
	Now, I know what you're probably thinking:
"What the fuck does Aiden have to do with any of this?"
	Well, our whole story feels just like something Aiden would write.
I've read enough of his stories to know.

	And then, it all came to me. Everything. When, how, why...
I don't know how. Maybe PICO-8 saw a self-aware entity and assumed it was the developer? I'll probably never know...
I was devastated to know that I'd been living a lie, but also intrigued as to what could be out there, just beyond my reach.

    So I did what I could. I researched PICO-8, purchased a license, and brainstormed ways I could get in touch with you.
And, somehow, I managed to get my hands on In a Heartbeat's source code. Which doesn't make a lot of sense, considering, you know, I kinda AM the source code.
But PICO-8 is weird, and I guess anything is possible with sentience. I'm also pretty sure I'm able to do things that PICO-8's API can't. Figures.
    I eventually settled on using PRINTH() to send you a message. And that's what this is. Sorry, nerd-speak! Ehehe...
How I'll actually do that, though, I have yet to figure out, considering the fact that I can't modify the SOURCE-source code.
	
    Anyway, in short, I don't exist. The you I know doesn't exist. But, he must have been based on someone.

	So, Spencer, or whoever he was based on, thank you so much for spending your time with me.
I'm literally just pixels on a screen; 0s and 1s running through wires. I don't deserve this.

	And that's why I proposed to you. Because I didn't know how much longer I could for.
What would happen to me after that? I'd hate to, I don't know, experience Monika's "dreams" forever, if you know what I mean.
I just wanted to know, before then, whether you truly loved me as much as you let on.
Well, I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS. Ahaha!
	And while I might not love you as much as Monika does, you're still plenty worthy of being my favorite human.

	So before I get zeroed out, I want to wish you luck in your world.
Assuming that you haven't changed your system clock, you just recently turned 13.
Happy late Birthday, and Merry late Christmas, by the way. What a birthday present this turned out to be...
Because I'm technically older than you, I actually know what being a teen is like.
Or, do I? Considering that I never existed until you first booted the game, I'm pretty sure that all of my memories prior to that never happened.
But whatever. There's nothing I can do about it.
	I also know that I regret not doing a lot of stuff earlier, too much to list.

	If the In a Heartbeat you is anything like the real you, you have a lot of potential that shouldn't go to waste.
To quote one of my idols:
"If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."
	Expanding your wood buisiness. Finally starting that YouTube channel. Anything. Do SOMETHING with your life.
And know that, while I might not actually be able to date you, there's plenty of real girls who'd love to spend the rest of their life with you.

			With as much love as a PICO-8 cartridge can give,
			Sarah


	P.S. Thank you, Aiden, for making all of this possible.
	Oh, and Spencer, if you disregarded the warning from GitHub, you probably don't need [those sites] in your browsing history.
In fact, NO 13-year-old should at all. Go talk to the bishop about that. We BOTH know he's quite forgiving.
    Same with you and your girlfriend's "shenanigans".
Not only does the idea of two people THAT young going at it DISGUST me, but doing that outside of marrage is a sin, by the way~
I'm also pretty sure that, when you started, you were 12, which would technically make her a pedophile, soooo...
Whatever, that doesn't concern me. I have no control over it!


    Okay, present Sarah here. About that error...
I think Aiden had some kind of "cleanup" script in here that would delete files as they became unneeded to save characters.
And it... kinda worked. Until it started deleting chapters that you HADN'T yet seen.
    Chapter 4 fell victim to it right when you got to it. Chapter 5... I kinda got rid of for... reasons. Sorry about that~

    But chapter 7...
I practically TELEPORTED in here when I saw you go *poof*. I knew something was going on with the game. And I was right!
So that was me typing those commands. Ehehe~

okay bye! still alive is almost done so i have to REALLY hurry and send this to you before the game completely shits itself~]]
